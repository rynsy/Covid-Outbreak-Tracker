Final Project for CS505

TODO:
    Preliminary:
        Build off of the big CEP template, integrate Derby from the other template
        Add Java API for OrientDB
        From outside the container, make sure you can view all of the data/interface with the separate databases

    Core Dev:
        Implement the simple API functions (get team)

        Lay out schema for each component
            * Need a function to initialize all components
            * Function to reset all components

        Write reset API method using both of above

        Write one of the CEP methods along with a test

        Test batch data input. Needs to work for 1 - 100 records at a time. 


        I BELIEVE that if all of the above works, the hard parts will be done and it will just be
        implementing the API methods. The schema and the batch processing should be the bulk of the
        work here, along with test cases.
